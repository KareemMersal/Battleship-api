## Background & Assumtions
I assume here that we have a software house that is produce games and the development sector is divided into 2 teams . Backend Team and frontend Team. I'm a software Engineer in the backend Team.
The development Team has rules and guildlines which restrain the work to follow the best practices.

## Branshes Names 

 The Guildlines says the branch name Must be The Type of story {Feature / hotfix} / Your team name - Story Number

 ## Why Doing such a big application while the test is far smaller ? ##

I Believe I need to show what I believe and how I solve issues.

## Stories Meaning 

I mean by the story is what needs to be done to add business value. For example create database as story won't add a value for business unless they use the database itself. so I will create the Database in Sub Task.
Sub-Tasks are Important to make the PR smaller. however I will name them as well as stories but I will mention here they are sub Tasks.

## Stories List
- Backend-001 : Add API Skeleton
- Backend-002 : Add API Basement
- Backend-003 : Add Database context (Sub - Task)
